# Problem Statement:
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that 
uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing 
the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the 
easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.  
This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the 
failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class 
indicates that the failure was caused by something else.
